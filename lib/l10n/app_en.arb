  "aboutParagraph": "My journey into tech started with my Computer Science studies at Kafr El-Sheikh University, after transferring from Luxor University.Over the past years, I’ve gained hands-on experience through training with the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI) and the Information Technology Institute (ITI), where I built real-world mobile apps using Flutter, Dart, Firebase, and REST APIs. I also worked with state management patterns like Cubit and Bloc, and focused on delivering clean, scalable, and maintainable code.Beyond coding, I value teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills I strengthened while collaborating on projects and mentoring peers.What sets me apart? I don’t just build apps, I build experiences.",
